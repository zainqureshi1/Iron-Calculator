    <string name="start__who_recommendation">The World Health Organization (WHO*) has recommended that pregnant women and new mothers be informed of the benefits and superiority of breast-feeding especially of early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for 6 months, in particular, the fact that it provides the best nutrition and protect babies from diarrhea and other illness. Mothers should be given guidance on the preparation for, and maintenance of lactation, the art of expressing out breastmilk, its storage and feeding it to the infant with special emphasis on the importance of a well-balanced diet both during pregnancy and after delivery. Unnecessary introduction of partial bottle-feeding or other foods and drinks should be discouraged since it will have a negative effect on breastfeeding as well as health of the infants. Similarly, mothers should be warned of the difficulty of reversing a decision not to breast feed even if bottle-feed is limited to a few bottles. Before advising a mother to use an infant formula on the recommendation of a healthcare professional, she should be advised of the social and financial implications of her decision: for example, if a baby is exclusively bottle-fed, more than one can (450g) per week will be needed, so the family circumstances and costs should be kept in mind. Mothers should be reminded that breast milk is not only the best nutrition, but also the most economical food for infants. If a decision to use an infant formula is taken, it is important to give instructions on correct preparation methods, emphasizing that unboiled water, unsterilized bottles or incorrect dilution can all lead to illness of the infants. The complementary foods must be given after the age of six months as an early introduction of the complementary food can have a bad effect on the health of the babies. The complementary foods can easily be prepared at home. The complementary foods must be given to infants above the age of six months with a cup and spoon, not in a feeding bottle.</string>
